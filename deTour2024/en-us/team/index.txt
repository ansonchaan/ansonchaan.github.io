17:T6ec,Shin Wong isn't just a curator—she's a creative powerhouse redefining Hong Kong's art and design landscape with her bold and fearless approach. With over 15 years of experience challenging the boundaries of entertainment, fashion, and the arts, Shin's name has become synonymous with innovation, conceptual brilliance, and impactful artist collaborations.

Since assuming leadership of the Hong Kong Design Festival ‘deTour' in 2015, Shin has elevated this annual event into a cultural phenomenon, attracting over 930,000 visitors to SoHo by 2023. Under her guidance, deTour has evolved from being more than just an event; it has become a movement.

In 2022, Shin expanded her visionary reach by launching ‘FabriX', Hong Kong's pioneering venture into digital fashion. In just a year, FabriX has already made a significant impact at London and Paris Fashion Week, featuring a cutting-edge AR kiosk where visitors can virtually try on designer pieces and pre-order limited-edition merchandise—all in a seamless, innovative experience.

Shin envisions the future of consumerism as an evolving landscape. For her, digital fashion transcends visual aesthetics; it serves as a powerful storytelling medium that advocates sustainability, inclusivity, and the freedom to express one's identity both physically and virtually.

Shin's curatorial portfolio is a testament to her avant-garde vision: from the haunting beauty of Ivana Wong's The Singing Canvases to the raw energy of Yamaguchi Soichi's “The Way You Look”, and the mind-bending Unparalleled Madness by Wang Qingsong. She's also the creative force behind “It is NOW” by Tom Binns, “PEDDERZINE Uncatalogued” by Theseus Chan for JOYCE, and PMQ's iconic “Smart Fashion Runway I & II”, among others.2:["$L12",["$","$L13",null,{"children":[["$","$L14",null,{}],["$","$L15",null,{"className":"w-full h-full","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"w-screen px-3 xl:px-6 h-svh flex justify-end lg:justify-center pt-16 pb-4 md:py-3 lg:pb-9 lg:pt-[5.5rem] xl:pb-[2.3125rem] xl:pt-[6.25rem] relative z-40","children":["$","$L16",null,{"page":{"id":"ZwqU3REAACkAd9wC","uid":"team","url":"/en-us/team","type":"page","href":"https://detour-2024.cdn.prismic.io/api/v2/documents/search?ref=Z4-CdBIAACsALHJ8&q=%5B%5B%3Ad+%3D+at%28document.id%2C+%22ZwqU3REAACkAd9wC%22%29+%5D%5D","tags":[],"first_publication_date":"2024-10-12T15:25:24+0000","last_publication_date":"2024-12-04T04:41:34+0000","slugs":["team"],"linked_documents":[],"lang":"en-us","alternate_languages":[{"id":"ZwqU6xEAACgAd9wb","type":"page","lang":"zh-hk","uid":"team"}],"data":{"title":[{"type":"heading1","text":"Team","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"}],"slices":[{"variation":"default","version":"initial","items":[],"primary":{"position_slug":"curator-at-large","position":"Curator-at-large","people":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":684,"height":400},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/ZxodcoF3NbkBX9rH_team_ShinWong.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"ZxodcoF3NbkBX9rH","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}},"name":"Shin Wong","description":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"$17","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"}],"ig_link":{"link_type":"Web","key":"fc7f755a-e9ac-40bc-8bc1-b616674e95d8","url":"https://www.instagram.com/theinvisiblelady/","target":"_blank"},"fb_link":{"link_type":"Any"},"website_link":{"link_type":"Any"}}]},"id":"team$12863c1f-a3fb-4362-b7df-66e56d9cfb02","slice_type":"team","slice_label":null},{"variation":"default","version":"initial","items":[],"primary":{"position_slug":"curator","position":"Curator","people":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":684,"height":400},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/ZyXyi68jQArT0IvI_team_Adonian2.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"ZyXyi68jQArT0IvI","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}},"name":"Adonian Chan","description":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Adonian Chan, Hong Kong-born type designer, graphic designer and design curator.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"\nHe has been studying Hong Kong Beiwei and digitising it into “Zansyu” font since 2011, and co-authored the book “A Study on Hong Kong Beiwei Calligraphy & Type Design” alongside design editor Ire Tsui in 2018.

2f:T6ec,Shin Wong isn't just a curator—she's a creative powerhouse redefining Hong Kong's art and design landscape with her bold and fearless approach. With over 15 years of experience challenging the boundaries of entertainment, fashion, and the arts, Shin's name has become synonymous with innovation, conceptual brilliance, and impactful artist collaborations.

Since assuming leadership of the Hong Kong Design Festival ‘deTour' in 2015, Shin has elevated this annual event into a cultural phenomenon, attracting over 930,000 visitors to SoHo by 2023. Under her guidance, deTour has evolved from being more than just an event; it has become a movement.

In 2022, Shin expanded her visionary reach by launching ‘FabriX', Hong Kong's pioneering venture into digital fashion. In just a year, FabriX has already made a significant impact at London and Paris Fashion Week, featuring a cutting-edge AR kiosk where visitors can virtually try on designer pieces and pre-order limited-edition merchandise—all in a seamless, innovative experience.

Shin envisions the future of consumerism as an evolving landscape. For her, digital fashion transcends visual aesthetics; it serves as a powerful storytelling medium that advocates sustainability, inclusivity, and the freedom to express one's identity both physically and virtually.

Shin's curatorial portfolio is a testament to her avant-garde vision: from the haunting beauty of Ivana Wong's The Singing Canvases to the raw energy of Yamaguchi Soichi's “The Way You Look”, and the mind-bending Unparalleled Madness by Wang Qingsong. She's also the creative force behind “It is NOW” by Tom Binns, “PEDDERZINE Uncatalogued” by Theseus Chan for JOYCE, and PMQ's iconic “Smart Fashion Runway I & II”, among others.30:[]

c1:T8fd,
Curated by Adonian Chan, this year’s theme, “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”, seeks to uncover underexplored possibilities in design, emphasising how design can enrich our inner strength. It invites the public to reflect on two values—“having” and “being”—and to foster deeper conversations and connections.

One of the festival’s highlights is the “International Collaboration”, featuring “REWORLD Type 2”, an installation by the Seoul-based studio Kimchi and Chips. Composed of more than 1,000 micro-prisms this work transforms real-world images, recomposing the surrounding landscape through a microprism and offering viewers a glimpse into a “new world”.

The curator presents four Feature Exhibitions, each offering a unique perspective on “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”. “A place of Being” was created by designers Wich Chau and Match Chen, it invites audiences to engage with the delicate balance between “having” and “losing”, as well as “balance” and “imbalance”, encouraging them to find equilibrium in their own personal journey. “Air-Scape” presents a collaboration between the design team Future Soil and penjing artist, Laurence Lee. A penjing crafted with hydroponic sponges and 3D-printed breathable structures to create fresh geometric expressions that revitalise the traditional art of penjing. Korean designer Yoojin Chung showcases “Capturing Qi (氣)”, a contemporary feng shui installation that, much like a scientific apparatus, captures and reveals the invisible “Qi”, thereby offering a musing on the commodification of feng shui. “Passage to the Lake”, by Netherlands-based Korean designer Moon Seop Seo, draws inspiration from the soothing presence of lakes. In this minimalist installation, droplets of water fall into a pool, continuously rejuvenating its surface. This piece brings a touch of nature into the city, offering a quiet moment of reflection amid the city’s bustle.

deTour 2024 will feature 17 installations by designers from Hong Kong and worldwide, as well as more than 40 workshops, 13 Creative Voice sessions, “deTour Kids” experience, and over 100 guided tours. Join us at PMQ for this annual celebration and discover the transformative power of design!12:["$","header",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"w-screen px-3 xl:px-6 flex justify-center
