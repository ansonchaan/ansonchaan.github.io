16:T508,Penjing is a fascinating art form that aligns with Erich Fromm’s philosophical ideas of “being” and “having”. Unlike the Western practice of cutting plants and flowers for short-lived arrangements in vases, the Eastern approach seeks to capture the essence and experience of nature through the creation of a living, breathing miniature landscape. The penjing artist acknowledges that this landscape is never fully controllable or static, as it grows and transforms over time.

This project offers a contemporary reinterpretation of penjing, an art that has seen few modern innovations. Traditional penjing often emphasises the manipulation of plant growth, with limited design possibilities for the vessel or rock, which are typically pre-selected elements. This project explores whether replacing these traditional components with 3D-printed structures could unlock new creative avenues in penjing design.

The project’s core lies in developing a material strategy that integrates soilless foam with perforated 3D-printed forms, allowing for customisable vessel shapes that support diverse plant species. This holistic approach bridges traditional penjing with computational design and digital fabrication, offering new geometric possibilities for the art form.17:T509,“Capturing Qi (氣)” offers a satirical critique of the evolving customs surrounding post-modern feng shui, questioning the contemporary mindset that prioritises consumption over the fundamental principles of harmony and balance.

Rooted in Eastern philosophy and cosmology, feng shui is traditionally centered on the dynamics of vital energy—Qi—which promotes well-being, prosperity, and good fortune. Recently, it has gained global traction, increasingly leaning toward the notion of quick fixes—solutions that can be easily and immediately implemented. This trend reflects our society’s escalating obsession with constant self-optimisation and improvement. The commodification of feng shui in the marketplace serves as a clear manifestation of this newly globalised hyperobject. By acquiring feng shui items, the intangible essence of qi becomes tangible, transforming the invisible into something visible.

This installation presents a modern kinetic feng shui device, inspired by one of the most popular commodified objects: the crystal ball. Derived from scientific apparatus, this device “captures” Qi inside transparent capsules, serving as a physical, vision-oriented tool offering a new perspective on controlling success in life with the invisible substance, Qi.18:T46e,Standing by a lake has a soothing effect on the mind, which is why designer Moon Seop Seo wanted to bring a piece of that tranquillity into his home. However, when he placed a glass of lake water he had collected on his table, the magic dissipated. Now, he aims to honour the essence of living water and harness its potential in urban settings by crafting a spatial experience that allows people to enjoy a moment of relaxation. He invites visitors to witness a droplet falling into a puddle, where it comes to life again, allowing them to experience the calming rhythm of water amidst the hustle and bustle of the city.

“Standing in front of a lake makes me calm.
I could stare at it for hours
I wanted to take the lake home with me.
So I took a glass of lake and brought it home.
With excitement, I placed the cup on my table.
The moment it was on the table,
It was dead.

I went back to the lake and sat closer.
Instead of trying to bring the lake home,
I created a small passage.
Whenever I am overwhelmed by the pace of the urban life,
I walk through the passage.
Standing in front of the passage to the lake makes me calm.”19:T4e2,Home is where one feels a sense of belonging and attachment, often in the physical form of a house. This sense of attachment transforms the ephemeral idea of home into a tangible shape, turning the state of being into a state of having.

In catastrophic events like earthquakes or tsunamis, the physical manifestation of our homes — And the emotions and memories they harbour — Becomes fragile. Everything we’ve built our lives around can be destroyed in an instant, leaving behind ruinations.

According to Erich Fromm’s statement, after such an impact, the shattered remnants of a house lose their value in terms of having. The deeper question then arises: Can any being — The intangible essence of value — Survive within the ruins, despite the degree of destruction?

Casa Destruct explores the notion, replicating the aftermath of a home belonging to anonymous hosts, left in ruins after an unknown catastrophe. The remains, Casa Destruct, provoke us to reflect on life in this simulated state of destruction. Does the ghost or being of the home endure, defending the idea that a certain matter lingers (Or retains) or is even revived after the destruction of its physical form… Or is everything lost when the house collapses?1a:T423,Studio Anthony Ko primarily engages in architecture, spatial designs, installations, and community projects, approaching the world with a theoretical lens. Through manifestos, the studio explores the provocative aspects of architecture, experimenting with themes such as place attachment, environmental psychology, and cultural preservation. Recently, Studio Anthony Ko has focused on designing spaces in remote and exilic environments, with a strong emphasis on well-being and emotional connection.

In 2023, Studio Anthony Ko was selected to represent Hong Kong at the Oku-Noto Triennale after winning the open call “Station by the Sea”, juried by Fram Kitagawa. Ko’s work was chosen by architect Peter Zumthor for participation in the SMACH Biennale in the Dolomites UNESCO site in Italy. The studio’s conceptual approach to embedding meaning in spaces is evident in projects such as Fragile World (Sai Kung Hoi Arts Festival), After Seventeen Days (deTour 2022), Natural Order (Via North Point), and Nostalgists (Take PARK in Art: Seats Together).1b:T53a,In everyday life, many people are motivated by the pursuit of “having”, striving for wealth and possessions as a means of achieving security and fulfilment . However, there’s a growing emphasis on the concept of “being”, which highlights the significance of present experiences and connections with others. To delve into these two perspectives, we developed an interactive installation titled “DIVINE”.

This installation features a fundamental framework along with multiple mirrors, each representing a unique aspect of the self. As viewers draw near, their reflections engage in a dialogue with their own identities. The shape of the installation shifts dynamically with audience participation, celebrating the joy of “being”.

The installation’s movement varies in speed based on the distance between viewers and the sensors. As more visitors approach, the amplitude of its opening and closing motions increases, rotating and expanding its form in a continuous cycle,enhanced by lights and natural sounds that symbolise human connections. We hope this experience inspires viewers to contemplate the difference between “having” and “being”, ultimately leading to a redefined understanding of life’s meaning.

Special thanks to DJ YAAT (@yaatofficial) for producing the background music for this exhibition.1c:T48b,“Hz Lab” reminds us that the essence of music is found not in the instruments we own but in the moments we share. By embracing the concept of “being” rather than “having”, we open ourselves to a realm where creativity thrives and connections deepen. This artistic exploration allows us to rediscover the transformative power of music and its profound impact on our lives.

Celebrating the joy of being present, “Hz Lab” invites participants to engage with music beyond conventional boundaries. It redefines the musical experience, enriching our human experience by emphasising community, creativity, and emotional connection. The project encourages us to reflect on our relationships with music and one another, highlighting how meaningful experiences often stem from collaboration and shared expression.

In a world that can feel increasingly fragmented, initiatives like “Hz Lab” inspire us to prioritiseconnection and creativity, fostering a sense of belonging and unity through sound. Ultimately, this project transforms our perception of music and our relationships, creating lasting memories that resonate far beyond the notes played.1d:T6e7,Islands stir our natural curiosity to explore the unknown. Since ancient times, our ancestors embarked on daring expeditions to reach these isolated lands, investing immense effort into charting maps, building ships, and constructing bridges to distant shores. Various forms of design, planning, and construction have not only reduced the distances between islands but, more importantly, created bridges of communication that connect us emotionally. Design facilitates connection.

Our proposal highlights the approximately 200 islands of Hong Kong, bringing their stories to life. The design comprises two components:

(A) Acrylic panels, each printed with point cloud data of an island obtained through aerial LiDAR technology, create an interactive archive installation reminiscent of a laboratory shelf. Spotlights encircle the inner side of the panels, projecting enlarged images of the island point clouds onto the walls. These motorised spotlights glide along a track, periodically pausing on different islands, as if illuminating the discovery of each island like guiding lights.

(B) Additionally, the design team has personally conducted site visits to several islands. Through photographs and 3D scanning, they documented unique features such as striking rock formations and varied terrain. These images are showcased in 35mm slides, displayed within wall-mounted lightboxes.

The proposal takes an archaeological and archivist approach to exploring the islands’ past, while also gesturing towards a speculative future through its digitised and technological aesthetics. This continuity between preservation and innovation reimagines how thoughtful design interventions might shape the islands' evolving roles in the region—and, in turn, our lives.1e:T5aa,Island Works is a collaborative initiative co-founded by Chi and Leroy, born out of their mutual fascination with Hong Kong’s islands, which is rooted in their identities as locals. With over 200 islands surrounding Hong Kong, this contrast stands out against its reputation as one of the world’s busiest metropolises. Having grown up in Hong Kong and later studying and working abroad, Chi and Leroy were captivated by the striking juxtaposition of the urban environment and the natural beauty of these islands, a uniqueness they believe is unmatched.

With this vision, Island Works aims to document and archive the islands of Hong Kong, ultimately creating a comprehensive digital library dedicated to these natural treasures. Through on-site visits, 3D scanning, and photography, the project seeks to capture and preserve the essence of each island, transforming these elements into a visually engaging platform for the public. Their ultimate goal is to establish an online repository that allows individuals to explore and share their findings.

Currently supported by the Design Trust seed grant, Chi and Leroy are preparing for a public launch of the project in the near future. Additionally, drawing from their expertise as designers and architects, they hope to create design interventions inspired by the islands, fostering a symbiotic relationship between their creative vision and the natural landscapes that ignite their inspiration.1f:T55c,“The People’s Pavilion” is designed as a space for self-discovery, reflection, and acceptance. Through a dynamic use of colours, each representing participants’ levels of satisfaction or “flavours” in different areas of life, the pavilion creates a vibrant metaphor for emotional complexity. These colours, interacting with mirrors and lighting, form a layered landscape, illustrating that emotional well-being is about finding balance across all feelings rather than prioritising any single one.

Promoting emotional authenticity, the pavilion encourages visitors to explore and express their full range of emotions, even in moments of bitterness or disappointment. It is an invitation to engage with one’s emotional journeys in a simple, honest way, fostering a deeper connection to themselves and the broader human experience.

This collective installation captures participants’ internal thoughts through playful interaction, creating shared memories for the community. It showcases how a pavilion can act as both a reflection of the surrounding social and cultural environment, as well as a space for gathering and dialogue. By transforming individual emotions into a visual narrative, “The  People’s  Pavilion” seeks to revolutionise the way communities express and strengthen their bonds by contributing their feelings to the evolving space.20:T445,the

This creates an immersive meditative environment for the visitor to reflect, and enrich the inner beings.21:T49d,This proposal explores the question: How do “I” become “myself”?

Victoria uses the pinball machine as a metaphor, encouraging people to rediscover their authentic selves through play. By reconnecting with our inner child, we tap into joy and creativity.

In this interactive experience, players are invited to imagine themselves as the ball, embarking on a journey filled with twists, turns, and obstacles. The racecourse, representing a space for ongoing self-reflection and inner exploration, is fully customisable—players can add or remove objects along the path. After each round, new insights may emerge, inspiring changes to the course and sparking further creativity.

In this analogy, the ball symbolises one’s life and way of “being”, while the racecourse represents our life’s journey. The obstacles reflect the possessions we accumulate, aligning with the concept of “having”. Victoria envisions these two modes of existence—being and having—not as conflicting forces, but as complementary, working together to deepen our self-understanding. Through playful engagement, we can embrace both our personal journey and the elements that shape it.22:T42c,Victoria Dong is a pioneering interdisciplinary designer who blends the thinking and design principles of both architecture and contemporary textiles. By exploring the intersection of material and space, she employs textile techniques to push design boundaries, championing inclusivity and creativity in all her projects.

Through the fusion of architectural principles and textile art, her innovative designs establish a sense of unity between time and place, reflecting the fluid and multi-dimensional nature of identity.

Victoria honed her craft at the Royal College of Art and the University of Hong Kong, where she developed a deep interest in the complexities of identity. Her visionary work emphasises the transformative role of textiles and collective creativity in shaping meaningful, inclusive environments. Currently based at Heatherwick Studio in London, she showcased her work at the Alveston Gallery in London, Royal Birmingham Society of Artists for the Prized Exhibition 2022 and created installations for the Hong Kong Museum of Art and K11 Art Mall.2:["$L11",["$","$L12",null,{"children":[["$","$L13",null,{}],["$","$L14",null,{"className":"w-full h-full","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"w-screen px-3 xl:px-6 pt-[9.5rem] lg:pt-[7rem] pb-6","children":["$","$L15",null,{"className":"[&>div]:gap-[1.5rem] [&>div>div]:gap-[1.5rem] md:[&>div]:gap-[2.5rem] md:[&>div>div]:gap-[2.5rem] xl:[&>div]:gap-[3.75rem] xl:[&>div>div]:gap-[3.75rem] px-3 md:px-7 xl:px-9 md:[&>div>div:nth-child(2)]:-mt-24 lg:[&>div>div:nth-child(1)]:-mt-16 lg:[&>div>div:nth-child(2)]:mt-8 lg:[&>div>div:nth-child(3)]:-mt-16","events_posts":[{"id":"ZwfSvxEAACoAc7eh","uid":"reworld-type-2","url":"/en-us/events/reworld-type-2","type":"events_post","href":"https://detour-2024.cdn.prismic.io/api/v2/documents/search?ref=Z4-CdBIAACsALHJ8&q=%5B%5B%3Ad+%3D+at%28document.id%2C+%22ZwfSvxEAACoAc7eh%22%29+%5D%5D","tags":["Exhibition"],"first_publication_date":"2024-10-10T13:12:42+0000","last_publication_date":"2024-12-08T08:07:38+0000","slugs":["reworld-type-2"],"linked_documents":[],"lang":"en-us","alternate_languages":[{"id":"ZwfTHxEAAC0Ac7hD","type":"events_post","lang":"zh-hk","uid":"reworld-type-2"}],"data":{"title":"REWORLD Type 2","category":{"id":"ZwiYpBEAACwAdOeI","type":"category","tags":[],"lang":"en-us","slug":"international-collaboration","first_publication_date":"2024-10-11T03:16:54+0000","last_publication_date":"2024-10-11T03:16:54+0000","uid":"international-collaboration","data":{"label":"International Collaboration"},"link_type":"Document","key":"68d1d700-f56c-4037-896f-e7a572459fba","isBroken":false},"gallery":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":800},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/Z062KJbqstJ97-Zu_IC01_ReworldType203.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"Z062KJbqstJ97-Zu","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":800},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/Z062JJbqstJ97-Zs_IC01_ReworldType201.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"Z062JJbqstJ97-Zs","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":800},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/Z062JZbqstJ97-Zt_IC01_ReworldType202.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"Z062JZbqstJ97-Zt","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1200},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/Z062KpbqstJ97-Zv_IC01_ReworldType204.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"Z062KpbqstJ97-Zv","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":800},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/Z062K5bqstJ97-Zw_IC01_ReworldType205.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"Z062K5bqstJ97-Zw","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":800},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/Z062LJbqstJ97-Zx_IC01_ReworldType206.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"Z062LJbqstJ97-Zx","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}}}],"description":[{"type":"paragraph","text":" <REWORLD Type 2> is an innovative urban screen that constructs images not with traditional LEDs, but by remixing fragments from the surrounding cityscape.

This way, the seemingly random and unpredictable movement of the pinball transforms into a novel and engaging musical composition, with each machine featuring its own distinct set of sound samples to enhance the uniqueness of the experience.\n\n“The Club” effectively merges the excitement of arcade gameplay with the creative expression of music, allowing players to move beyond traditional gaming and engage in authentic musical creation.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"}],"related_event":{"id":"ZyYYHhEAAC0AO9Ku","type":"events_post","tags":["Design Dialogue"],"lang":"en-us","slug":"music-shaped-by-design","first_publication_date":"2024-11-02T12:16:49+0000","last_publication_date":"2024-12-09T11:57:37+0000","uid":"music-shaped-by-design","url":"/en-us/events/music-shaped-by-design","link_type":"Document","key":"c93bac2e-30b3-4ca8-8d44-7e31e1032f97","isBroken":false},"slices":[],"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_image":{},"additional_location_details":[],"slices2":[{"variation":"default","version":"initial","items":[],"primary":{"location":"Marketplace, PMQ","location_number":8,"notes":null,"dates":[{"available_from":"2024-11-29T03:00:00+0000","available_to":"2024-12-15T12:00:00+0000","booking_link":{"link_type":"Any"},"full_booking":false}]},"id":"location_and_dates$de1469cf-9c22-4031-8497-9cbc4f16cfea","slice_type":"location_and_dates","slice_label":null}],"slices3":[{"variation":"creativeStudio","version":"initial","items":[],"primary":{"studio":[{"name":"Ng Chak Lam","image":{"dimensions":{"width":512,"height":512},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/ZznQra8jQArT08b8_13-profile.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"ZznQra8jQArT08b8","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}},"description":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chaklam Ng is a sound artist and inventor of musical instruments based in Hong Kong.

Yet, regardless of the path we choose, we rely on external objects to help us achieve our goals.\n\nInterestingly, tools themselves are also in an unfinished state. A pen, for instance, only exists as a pen when it is used to write; without that action, it is merely an object. This reveals how the unfinishedness of individuals and objects is intricately connected.\n\nThis exhibition seeks to explore the mutual influence between humans and objects. Things can shape our identities, and in turn, we can shape the things around us. Passive users often become standard users, conforming to the limitations of the objects they use. In contrast, active users are creators; they reshape objects, integrating them into their identities and, through their engagement, express their true selves.","spans":[],"direction":"ltr"}],"related_event":{"id":"Z0XgMxEAAC0AGCxv","type":"events_post","tags":["Workshop"],"lang":"en-us","slug":"unfinished-ready-made","first_publication_date":"2024-11-26T14:50:29+0000","last_publication_date":"2025-01-08T06:52:17+0000","uid":"unfinished-ready-made","url":"/en-us/events/unfinished-ready-made","link_type":"Document","key":"b52caf66-d230-451f-a674-60e7be2fdab3","isBroken":false},"slices":[],"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_image":{},"additional_location_details":[],"slices2":[{"variation":"default","version":"initial","items":[],"primary":{"location":"S506, 5/F, Block A, PMQ","location_number":15,"notes":null,"dates":[{"available_from":"2024-11-29T03:00:00+0000","available_to":"2024-12-15T12:00:00+0000","booking_link":{"link_type":"Any"},"full_booking":false}]},"id":"location_and_dates$5a336fc0-d315-4ded-9d66-1865ade43449","slice_type":"location_and_dates","slice_label":null}],"slices3":[{"variation":"creativeStudio","version":"initial","items":[],"primary":{"studio":[{"name":"Chang Hoi Wood","image":{"dimensions":{"width":512,"height":512},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/detour-2024/ZznT_K8jQArT08co_16-profile1.jpg?auto=format,compress","id":"ZznT_K8jQArT08co","edit":{"x":0,"y":0,"zoom":1,"background":"transparent"}},"description":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chang Hoi-wood is a Hong Kong-born artist who studied architecture and practised at EDGE Design Institute, where he oversaw the “Suitcase House” project.

Curated by Adonian Chan, this year’s theme, “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”, seeks to uncover underexplored possibilities in design, emphasising how design can enrich our inner strength. It invites the public to reflect on two values—“having” and “being”—and to foster deeper conversations and connections.

One of the festival’s highlights is the “International Collaboration”, featuring “REWORLD Type 2”, an installation by the Seoul-based studio Kimchi and Chips. Composed of more than 1,000 micro-prisms this work transforms real-world images, recomposing the surrounding landscape through a microprism and offering viewers a glimpse into a “new world”.

The curator presents four Feature Exhibitions, each offering a unique perspective on “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”. “A place of Being” was created by designers Wich Chau and Match Chen, it invites audiences to engage with the delicate balance between “having” and “losing”, as well as “balance” and “imbalance”, encouraging them to find equilibrium in their own personal journey. “Air-Scape” presents a collaboration between the design team Future Soil and penjing artist, Laurence Lee. A penjing crafted with hydroponic sponges and 3D-printed breathable structures to create fresh geometric expressions that revitalise the traditional art of penjing. Korean designer Yoojin Chung showcases “Capturing Qi (氣)”, a contemporary feng shui installation that, much like a scientific apparatus, captures and reveals the invisible “Qi”, thereby offering a musing on the commodification of feng shui. “Passage to the Lake”, by Netherlands-based Korean designer Moon Seop Seo, draws inspiration from the soothing presence of lakes. In this minimalist installation, droplets of water fall into a pool, continuously rejuvenating its surface. This piece brings a touch of nature into the city, offering a quiet moment of reflection amid the city’s bustle.

deTour 2024 will feature 17 installations by designers from Hong Kong and worldwide, as well as more than 40 workshops, 13 Creative Voice sessions, “deTour Kids” experience, and over 100 guided tours. Join us at PMQ for this annual celebration and discover the transformative power of design!26:[]
