17:T540,Design has long been seen as an instrument for “solving problems”. However, with advancing production methods and material abundance, design has shifted from merely addressing needs to fueling desire, where its value is mostly measured by ownership. This change echoes Erich Fromm's concept of the “mode of having” in his book To Have or To Be. Fromm argues that society frequently judges a person’s worth based on their possessions, implying that the more one has, the more valuable they are. Yet, he asserts that losing possessions does not reduce a person’s inherent value, as true value lies not in what we “have” but in who we “are”— the “mode of being”. 

The “mode of being” relates to the intrinsic inalienable qualities of a person. Unlike “having”, which is external, “being” is an internal state, nurtured through self-cultivation and awareness, contemplation, creative expression, and learning. Design can act as a catalyst for fostering this inner growth. By shaping environments, products, and experiences, design can deeply influence the inner self — encouraging personal growth, emotional and mental well-being, creative expression, and stronger interpersonal connections. With directed and thoughtful design, we can create spaces and tools that cultivate and reflect our truest selves. 18:T7ac,
One of the festival’s highlights is the “International Collaboration”, featuring “REWORLD Type 2”, an installation by the Seoul-based studio Kimchi and Chips. Composed of more than 1,000 micro-prisms this work transforms real-world images, recomposing the surrounding landscape through a microprism and offering viewers a glimpse into a “new world”.

The curator presents four Feature Exhibitions, each offering a unique perspective on “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”. “A place of Being” was created by designers Wich Chau and Match Chen, it invites audiences to engage with the delicate balance between “having” and “losing”, as well as “balance” and “imbalance”, encouraging them to find equilibrium in their own personal journey. “Air-Scape” presents a collaboration between the design team Future Soil and penjing artist, Laurence Lee. A penjing crafted with hydroponic sponges and 3D-printed breathable structures to create fresh geometric expressions that revitalise the traditional art of penjing. Korean designer Yoojin Chung showcases “Capturing Qi (氣)”, a contemporary feng shui installation that, much like a scientific apparatus, captures and reveals the invisible “Qi”, thereby offering a musing on the commodification of feng shui. “Passage to the Lake”, by Netherlands-based Korean designer Moon Seop Seo, draws inspiration from the soothing presence of lakes. In this minimalist installation, droplets of water fall into a pool, continuously rejuvenating its surface. This piece brings a touch of nature into the city, offering a quiet moment of reflection amid the city’s bustle.

deTour 2024 will feature 17 installations by designers from Hong Kong and worldwide, as well as more than 40 workshops, 13 Creative Voice sessions, “deTour Kids” experience, and over 100 guided tours. Join us at PMQ for this annual celebration and discover the transformative power of design!19:T407,The Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) established in June 2024, formerly known as Create Hong Kong (CreateHK), is a dedicated office set up by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR Government) under the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to provide one-stop services and support to the cultural and creative industries with a mission to foster a conducive environment in Hong Kong to facilitate the development of arts, culture and creative sectors as industries.

2c:T540,Design has long been seen as an instrument for “solving problems”. However, with advancing production methods and material abundance, design has shifted from merely addressing needs to fueling desire, where its value is mostly measured by ownership. This change echoes Erich Fromm's concept of the “mode of having” in his book To Have or To Be. Fromm argues that society frequently judges a person’s worth based on their possessions, implying that the more one has, the more valuable they are. Yet, he asserts that losing possessions does not reduce a person’s inherent value, as true value lies not in what we “have” but in who we “are”— the “mode of being”. 

The “mode of being” relates to the intrinsic inalienable qualities of a person. Unlike “having”, which is external, “being” is an internal state, nurtured through self-cultivation and awareness, contemplation, creative expression, and learning. Design can act as a catalyst for fostering this inner growth. By shaping environments, products, and experiences, design can deeply influence the inner self — encouraging personal growth, emotional and mental well-being, creative expression, and stronger interpersonal connections. With directed and thoughtful design, we can create spaces and tools that cultivate and reflect our truest selves. 2d:[]

Curated by Adonian Chan, this year’s theme, “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”, seeks to uncover underexplored possibilities in design, emphasising how design can enrich our inner strength. It invites the public to reflect on two values—“having” and “being”—and to foster deeper conversations and connections. ","spans":"$34","direction":"ltr"}
37:T7ac,
One of the festival’s highlights is the “International Collaboration”, featuring “REWORLD Type 2”, an installation by the Seoul-based studio Kimchi and Chips. Composed of more than 1,000 micro-prisms this work transforms real-world images, recomposing the surrounding landscape through a microprism and offering viewers a glimpse into a “new world”.

The curator presents four Feature Exhibitions, each offering a unique perspective on “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”. “A place of Being” was created by designers Wich Chau and Match Chen, it invites audiences to engage with the delicate balance between “having” and “losing”, as well as “balance” and “imbalance”, encouraging them to find equilibrium in their own personal journey. “Air-Scape” presents a collaboration between the design team Future Soil and penjing artist, Laurence Lee. A penjing crafted with hydroponic sponges and 3D-printed breathable structures to create fresh geometric expressions that revitalise the traditional art of penjing. Korean designer Yoojin Chung showcases “Capturing Qi (氣)”, a contemporary feng shui installation that, much like a scientific apparatus, captures and reveals the invisible “Qi”, thereby offering a musing on the commodification of feng shui. “Passage to the Lake”, by Netherlands-based Korean designer Moon Seop Seo, draws inspiration from the soothing presence of lakes. In this minimalist installation, droplets of water fall into a pool, continuously rejuvenating its surface. This piece brings a touch of nature into the city, offering a quiet moment of reflection amid the city’s bustle.

deTour 2024 will feature 17 installations by designers from Hong Kong and worldwide, as well as more than 40 workshops, 13 Creative Voice sessions, “deTour Kids” experience, and over 100 guided tours. Join us at PMQ for this annual celebration and discover the transformative power of design!39:{"start":349,"end":350,"type":"em"}
