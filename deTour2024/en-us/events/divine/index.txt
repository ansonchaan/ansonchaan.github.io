12:T53a,In everyday life, many people are motivated by the pursuit of “having”, striving for wealth and possessions as a means of achieving security and fulfilment . However, there’s a growing emphasis on the concept of “being”, which highlights the significance of present experiences and connections with others. To delve into these two perspectives, we developed an interactive installation titled “DIVINE”.

This installation features a fundamental framework along with multiple mirrors, each representing a unique aspect of the self. As viewers draw near, their reflections engage in a dialogue with their own identities. The shape of the installation shifts dynamically with audience participation, celebrating the joy of “being”.

The installation’s movement varies in speed based on the distance between viewers and the sensors. As more visitors approach, the amplitude of its opening and closing motions increases, rotating and expanding its form in a continuous cycle,enhanced by lights and natural sounds that symbolise human connections. We hope this experience inspires viewers to contemplate the difference between “having” and “being”, ultimately leading to a redefined understanding of life’s meaning.

Curated by Adonian Chan, this year’s theme, “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”, seeks to uncover underexplored possibilities in design, emphasising how design can enrich our inner strength. It invites the public to reflect on two values—“having” and “being”—and to foster deeper conversations and connections.

One of the festival’s highlights is the “International Collaboration”, featuring “REWORLD Type 2”, an installation by the Seoul-based studio Kimchi and Chips. Composed of more than 1,000 micro-prisms this work transforms real-world images, recomposing the surrounding landscape through a microprism and offering viewers a glimpse into a “new world”.

The curator presents four Feature Exhibitions, each offering a unique perspective on “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”. “A place of Being” was created by designers Wich Chau and Match Chen, it invites audiences to engage with the delicate balance between “having” and “losing”, as well as “balance” and “imbalance”, encouraging them to find equilibrium in their own personal journey. “Air-Scape” presents a collaboration between the design team Future Soil and penjing artist, Laurence Lee. A penjing crafted with hydroponic sponges and 3D-printed breathable structures to create fresh geometric expressions that revitalise the traditional art of penjing. Korean designer Yoojin Chung showcases “Capturing Qi (氣)”, a contemporary feng shui installation that, much like a scientific apparatus, captures and reveals the invisible “Qi”, thereby offering a musing on the commodification of feng shui. “Passage to the Lake”, by Netherlands-based Korean designer Moon Seop Seo, draws inspiration from the soothing presence of lakes. In this minimalist installation, droplets of water fall into a pool, continuously rejuvenating its surface. This piece brings a touch of nature into the city, offering a quiet moment of reflection amid the city’s bustle.

deTour 2024 will feature 17 installations by designers from Hong Kong and worldwide, as well as more than 40 workshops, 13 Creative Voice sessions, “deTour Kids” experience, and over 100 guided tours. Join us at PMQ for this annual celebration and discover the transformative power of design!1e:["Exhibition"]

3a:T53a,In everyday life, many people are motivated by the pursuit of “having”, striving for wealth and possessions as a means of achieving security and fulfilment . However, there’s a growing emphasis on the concept of “being”, which highlights the significance of present experiences and connections with others. To delve into these two perspectives, we developed an interactive installation titled “DIVINE”.

This installation features a fundamental framework along with multiple mirrors, each representing a unique aspect of the self. As viewers draw near, their reflections engage in a dialogue with their own identities. The shape of the installation shifts dynamically with audience participation, celebrating the joy of “being”.

The installation’s movement varies in speed based on the distance between viewers and the sensors. As more visitors approach, the amplitude of its opening and closing motions increases, rotating and expanding its form in a continuous cycle,enhanced by lights and natural sounds that symbolise human connections. We hope this experience inspires viewers to contemplate the difference between “having” and “being”, ultimately leading to a redefined understanding of life’s meaning.

Special thanks to DJ YAAT (@yaatofficial) for producing the background music for this exhibition.3b:[]
