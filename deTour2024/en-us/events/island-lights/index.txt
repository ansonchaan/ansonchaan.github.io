12:T6e7,Islands stir our natural curiosity to explore the unknown. Since ancient times, our ancestors embarked on daring expeditions to reach these isolated lands, investing immense effort into charting maps, building ships, and constructing bridges to distant shores. Various forms of design, planning, and construction have not only reduced the distances between islands but, more importantly, created bridges of communication that connect us emotionally. Design facilitates connection.

Our proposal highlights the approximately 200 islands of Hong Kong, bringing their stories to life. The design comprises two components:

(A) Acrylic panels, each printed with point cloud data of an island obtained through aerial LiDAR technology, create an interactive archive installation reminiscent of a laboratory shelf. Spotlights encircle the inner side of the panels, projecting enlarged images of the island point clouds onto the walls. These motorised spotlights glide along a track, periodically pausing on different islands, as if illuminating the discovery of each island like guiding lights.

(B) Additionally, the design team has personally conducted site visits to several islands. Through photographs and 3D scanning, they documented unique features such as striking rock formations and varied terrain. These images are showcased in 35mm slides, displayed within wall-mounted lightboxes.

The proposal takes an archaeological and archivist approach to exploring the islands’ past, while also gesturing towards a speculative future through its digitised and technological aesthetics. This continuity between preservation and innovation reimagines how thoughtful design interventions might shape the islands' evolving roles in the region—and, in turn, our lives.13:T6e7,Islands stir our natural curiosity to explore the unknown.

With over 200 islands surrounding Hong Kong, this contrast stands out against its reputation as one of the world’s busiest metropolises. Having grown up in Hong Kong and later studying and working abroad, Chi and Leroy were captivated by the striking juxtaposition of the urban environment and the natural beauty of these islands, a uniqueness they believe is unmatched.

With this vision, Island Works aims to document and archive the islands of Hong Kong, ultimately creating a comprehensive digital library dedicated to these natural treasures. Through on-site visits, 3D scanning, and photography, the project seeks to capture and preserve the essence of each island, transforming these elements into a visually engaging platform for the public. Their ultimate goal is to establish an online repository that allows individuals to explore and share their findings.

Currently supported by the Design Trust seed grant, Chi and Leroy are preparing for a public launch of the project in the near future. Additionally, drawing from their expertise as designers and architects, they hope to create design interventions inspired by the islands, fostering a symbiotic relationship between their creative vision and the natural landscapes that ignite their inspiration.1e:T8fd,
Curated by Adonian Chan, this year’s theme, “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”, seeks to uncover underexplored possibilities in design, emphasising how design can enrich our inner strength. It invites the public to reflect on two values—“having” and “being”—and to foster deeper conversations and connections.

One of the festival’s highlights is the “International Collaboration”, featuring “REWORLD Type 2”, an installation by the Seoul-based studio Kimchi and Chips. Composed of more than 1,000 micro-prisms this work transforms real-world images, recomposing the surrounding landscape through a microprism and offering viewers a glimpse into a “new world”.

The curator presents four Feature Exhibitions, each offering a unique perspective on “Having → Being: Designing Inner Worlds”. “A place of Being” was created by designers Wich Chau and Match Chen, it invites audiences to engage with the delicate balance between “having” and “losing”, as well as “balance” and “imbalance”, encouraging them to find equilibrium in their own personal journey. “Air-Scape” presents a collaboration between the design team Future Soil and penjing artist, Laurence Lee. A penjing crafted with hydroponic sponges and 3D-printed breathable structures to create fresh geometric expressions that revitalise the traditional art of penjing. Korean designer Yoojin Chung showcases “Capturing Qi (氣)”, a contemporary feng shui installation that, much like a scientific apparatus, captures and reveals the invisible “Qi”, thereby offering a musing on the commodification of feng shui. “Passage to the Lake”, by Netherlands-based Korean designer Moon Seop Seo, draws inspiration from the soothing presence of lakes. In this minimalist installation, droplets of water fall into a pool, continuously rejuvenating its surface. This piece brings a touch of nature into the city, offering a quiet moment of reflection amid the city’s bustle.

deTour 2024 will feature 17 installations by designers from Hong Kong and worldwide, as well as more than 40 workshops, 13 Creative Voice sessions, “deTour Kids” experience, and over 100 guided tours. Join us at PMQ for this annual celebration and discover the transformative power of design!1f:["Exhibition"]

3f:T6e7,Islands stir our natural curiosity to explore the unknown. Since ancient times, our ancestors embarked on daring expeditions to reach these isolated lands, investing immense effort into charting maps, building ships, and constructing bridges to distant shores. Various forms of design, planning, and construction have not only reduced the distances between islands but, more importantly, created bridges of communication that connect us emotionally. Design facilitates connection.

Our proposal highlights the approximately 200 islands of Hong Kong, bringing their stories to life. The design comprises two components:

(A) Acrylic panels, each printed with point cloud data of an island obtained through aerial LiDAR technology, create an interactive archive installation reminiscent of a laboratory shelf. Spotlights encircle the inner side of the panels, projecting enlarged images of the island point clouds onto the walls. These motorised spotlights glide along a track, periodically pausing on different islands, as if illuminating the discovery of each island like guiding lights.

(B) Additionally, the design team has personally conducted site visits to several islands. Through photographs and 3D scanning, they documented unique features such as striking rock formations and varied terrain. These images are showcased in 35mm slides, displayed within wall-mounted lightboxes.

The proposal takes an archaeological and archivist approach to exploring the islands’ past, while also gesturing towards a speculative future through its digitised and technological aesthetics. This continuity between preservation and innovation reimagines how thoughtful design interventions might shape the islands' evolving roles in the region—and, in turn, our lives.40:[]

68:T5aa,Island Works is a collaborative initiative co-founded by Chi and Leroy, born out of their mutual fascination with Hong Kong’s islands, which is rooted in their identities as locals. With over 200 islands surrounding Hong Kong, this contrast stands out against its reputation as one of the world’s busiest metropolises. Having grown up in Hong Kong and later studying and working abroad, Chi and Leroy were captivated by the striking juxtaposition of the urban environment and the natural beauty of these islands, a uniqueness they believe is unmatched.

With this vision, Island Works aims to document and archive the islands of Hong Kong, ultimately creating a comprehensive digital library dedicated to these natural treasures. Through on-site visits, 3D scanning, and photography, the project seeks to capture and preserve the essence of each island, transforming these elements into a visually engaging platform for the public. Their ultimate goal is to establish an online repository that allows individuals to explore and share their findings.

Currently supported by the Design Trust seed grant, Chi and Leroy are preparing for a public launch of the project in the near future. Additionally, drawing from their expertise as designers and architects, they hope to create design interventions inspired by the islands, fostering a symbiotic relationship between their creative vision and the natural landscapes that ignite their inspiration.69:[]
