Utilising train container as canvas, Hong Kong artist Vivian Ho aims to showcase the unique cultural history and community life of Sha Tau Kok through vibrant and colourful illustrations. <br/><br/>This portrayal not only highlights the evolving landscape of the area but also emphasises the rich tapestry of life that defines the community. Visitors can see the depictions of local shops, street vendors, and everyday interactions, experiencing a sense of nostalgia and connection to the past. Sha Tau Kok is brought to life through Vivian’s fantastical drawings of unique festive scenes, such as on-land dragon boat parade and fish lantern dances, bringing the excitement of local traditions to visitors. <br/><br/>Vivian’s unique style challenges conventional notions of beauty, embracing both authenticity and the grotesque, while infusing her illustrations with humour and surrealism. A multi-media immersive experience inside the carriage further enhances the narrative by offering glimpses into the daily lives of residents, which are filled with warmth and humanity.
