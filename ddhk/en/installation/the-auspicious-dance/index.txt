e:T59d,Hong Kong artist Louis To Wun grew up in a household deeply rooted in the art of paper crafting. With both of his parents practicing the craft, his passion was ignited from a very young age. After moving to Cheung Chau, he found inspiration in the vibrant community of boat dwellers that reminded him of his own childhood home. This connection to his past fueled his creativity, leading him to incorporate elements such as fish, the beautiful coastline of Sha Tau Kok, and barbed wire symbolising the closed area into <span style="font-weight: bold;">“The Auspicious Dance”</span>.  These motifs reflect his personal journey and the rich cultural significance they hold, allowing him to celebrate both heritage and the beauty of everyday life.<br/><br/>To Wun transforms <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Sha Tau Kok Square</span> into a vibrant stage that embodies the spirit of the sea. On-site, the artist paints colours on the artwork, adding vibrant hues to the area. Using a fusion of traditional sculpting techniques and modern metal art design, he creates an immersive environment where fishes dance amidst undulating waves. These dynamic pieces represent the harmony between humanity and nature, while the leaping fishes symbolize prosperity and contentment felt by the Chinese community. Through this artistic endeavor, Louis honours the fishermen’s customs and their relationship with the sea.2:["$","main",null,{"className":"page_main__gfnrJ","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page_main_wrapper__zjNIc","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"page_header__kiItp","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page_header_wrapper__2qwTO","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_images__vkiX6","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"settings":{"arrows":true,"dots":true,"infinite":true,"speed":500,"slidesToShow":1,"slidesToScroll":1,"adaptiveHeight":true},"data":[{"src":"/images/installations/01_Cover_The-Auspicious-Dance.jpg","alt":"The Auspicious Dance"},{"src":"/images/installations/6-ddhk-1207-06-1.jpg","alt":"The Auspicious Dance"},{"src":"/images/installations/6-ddhk-1207-06-4.jpg","alt":"The Auspicious Dance"},{"src":"/images/installations/6-ddhk-1207-06-5.jpg","alt":"The Auspicious Dance"}],"styles":{"main":"page_main__gfnrJ","main_wrapper":"page_main_wrapper__zjNIc","header":"page_header__kiItp","meta":"page_meta__oPixQ","separator":"page_separator__LuR4b","title":"page_title__rBPMj","author_name":"page_author_name__G8IF9","body":"page_body__LrBny","images":"page_images__vkiX6","dot":"page_dot__MQUz1","image":"page_image__Z24op","intro":"page_intro__6XqtF","description":"page_description__5gvqJ","author":"page_author___YZnz","author_wrapper":"page_author_wrapper__Ba22F","author_thumbnail":"page_author_thumbnail__KNykF","author_content":"page_author_content__gdmQy","author_about":"page_author_about__Drd0n","author_title":"page_author_title__ptatS","author_description":"page_author_description__Na502","cta":"page_cta__drOXU","cta_link":"page_cta_link__Xz6H4","header_wrapper":"page_header_wrapper__2qwTO"}}],false]}],"$undefined"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"$undefined","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"$undefined","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_meta__oPixQ","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"$undefined","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"$undefined","children":"Sha Tau Kok"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"page_separator__LuR4b","children":"•"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"$undefined","children":"Sha Tau Kok Square"}]]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"page_title__rBPMj","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"The Auspicious Dance"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_author_name__G8IF9","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"Louis To Wun"}}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_body__LrBny","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_intro__6XqtF","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"The artist transforms Sha Tau Kok Square into a dynamic stage, merging traditional sculpting techniques with modern design.
